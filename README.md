# AllScriptsFromGames

I am learning making indie games during my free time from YouTube or Udemy. All assets are mine created by Blender.
"Testing" games ware 2 weeks challenges inspirated by Adam Graham from Zingurous.
Codes can be little edited (mostly working with Objects, less Voids / Methods), but there are my first games to understanding 
working with OOP and Objects, and even two weeks for design, preparing hole code to run function game (there were 
very little time to me for editing code to seem nicely). But i appreciate for this experiences.
